# **Coronavirus tracker app**

Tracking the current infection status of the Corona Virus.

A web app created using Spring Boot and Java. I have used Thymeleaf and bootstrap for templating HTML and CSS. This is a pretty simple app. I have used Commons CSV library to read and parse csv file. It is not an REST API.

2. No Unit tests :(.
